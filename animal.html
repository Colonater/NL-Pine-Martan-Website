                <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>Pine martens have a diet that mainly consists of small mammals, 
                birds, insects, and fruit. They are solitary animals
                 and have a home range of around 4-5 square kilometers. 
                 They are also excellent climbers and swimmers,
                 which allows them to move easily through their forest habitats.</p>

                <p>
                    The Newfoundland Pine Martian is considered a special concern by the Canadian Goverment.
                    Habitat loss and trapping for its valuble fur are the main threats to the species.
                    Conservation efforts include habitat protection and management, and regulations on trapping.
                    Experts eestimate less then 3000 Newfoundland pine martans rome the island, seeing one is a once 
                    in a life time opportunity.
